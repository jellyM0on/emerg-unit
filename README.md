## Emergency Unit Problem

- Simulates a Genetic Alogrithm approach in solving the Emergency Unit Problem which aims to: allocate an Emergency Unit to the most efficient location in which it will be able to give service to all of the locations given as quick as possible in a given 10x10 city map. 
- The response time of the fire station is estimated to be 1.7 + 3.4r minutes, where r is in kilometers.
